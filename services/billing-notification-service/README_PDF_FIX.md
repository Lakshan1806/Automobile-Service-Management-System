# Billing Notification Service - PDF Generation Fix

## Issue Fixed
Users were receiving PDF files via email but could not open them because the PDFs were being generated as plain text files instead of proper PDF format.

## Solution
Updated the PDF generation code to use **ReportLab** library to generate proper, valid PDF files that can be opened in any PDF reader.

## Changes Made

### 1. **bill_service.py** - Complete PDF Generation Overhaul
- Replaced plain text file generation with ReportLab PDF generation
- PDFs are generated **in-memory** (no files saved to disk)
- Professional-looking bill layout with:
  - Centered title with custom styling
  - Bill information (ID, customer email, date)
  - Formatted table with items, prices, quantities, and subtotals
  - Alternating row colors for better readability
  - Bold total row with highlighted background
  - Thank you message at the bottom

### 2. **email_service.py** - Memory-based PDF Attachment
- Updated to use in-memory PDF buffer instead of file paths
- Generates PDF on-demand when sending email
- No temporary files created or cleaned up

### 3. **utils.py** - Updated Imports
- Removed `os` import (no longer needed for file operations)
- Added `BytesIO` for in-memory PDF handling

### 4. **views.py** - Streamlined Bill Generation
- Removed unnecessary PDF generation call in `generate_bill` endpoint
- PDFs are only generated when sending emails (on-demand)

## Dependencies

### Required Package
- **reportlab** (v4.4.4) - For professional PDF generation

Install with:
```bash
pip install reportlab
```

Or use the requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing

A test script is included: `test_pdf.py`

Run the test:
```bash
python test_pdf.py
```

This will:
1. Create a test bill with sample items
2. Generate a PDF in memory
3. Verify the PDF is valid (checks for %PDF header)
4. Save a test PDF file for manual inspection
5. Clean up test data

## Benefits

✅ **Valid PDFs** - Generated PDFs can be opened in any PDF reader  
✅ **Professional Look** - Well-formatted bills with proper styling  
✅ **No Disk Storage** - PDFs generated in-memory, reducing disk I/O  
✅ **On-Demand Generation** - PDFs only created when needed  
✅ **Clean Workspace** - No PDF files cluttering the project directory  
✅ **Better Performance** - Faster generation without file system operations  

## API Endpoints

### Generate Bill
```http
POST /api/generate-bill/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
  "items": [
    {"name": "Oil Change", "price": 50.00, "quantity": 1},
    {"name": "Tire Rotation", "price": 40.00, "quantity": 1}
  ]

```

```http

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "bill_id": "your-bill-uuid-here"
}
```

The PDF will be automatically generated and attached to the email when using the send bill endpoint.

## PDF Format

The generated PDF includes:
- **Header**: "Automobile Service Bill" (centered, bold, large font)
- **Bill Information**: 
  - Bill ID
  - Customer Email
  - Date and Time (formatted nicely)
- **Items Table**:
  - Item name, price, quantity, subtotal
  - Alternating row colors
  - Bold header row with dark background
  - Total row highlighted
- **Footer**: Thank you message

## Notes

- The `bills/` folder is now ignored in `.gitignore`
- Any existing PDF files in the `bills/` folder can be safely deleted
- PDFs are generated fresh each time an email is sent
- PDF generation happens in the virtual environment with all dependencies installed
